SCAPI (Strawberry Chat API) is the API for, you guessed it, Strawberry Chat. It allows developers to make custom bot
for Strawberry Chat.

<Tip>
    ### Compatibility Mode (CM)
    As of Scapi Canary v0.12.0, we have added a feature that allows bots to connect to old servers.
    This is called Compatibility Mode.
    [See more](/json-communication/introduction)
</Tip>

<Warning>Manual configuration of the compatibility mode is currently only available for Scapi Canary v0.12.1.</Warning>

**¹** Scapi Canary `v0.12.0` does not have manual configuration of the compatibility mode. You must change an argument in Scapi's source code for the configuration.
We therefore recommend to always use the latest available version from our [Canary GitHub branch](https://github.com/Strawberry-Foundations/strawberry-chat/tree/json-communication)

**²** Scapi Dev `v0.11.0` only supports the old, legacy communication system (v1.8.1 or lower). Using `v0.11.0` on a newer server (v1.9.0 or higher) will result in broken messages
