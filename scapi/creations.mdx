# What is this?
This documentation page shows you what we have already done with SCAPI, and what is and will soon be possible!

# Discord Chat Bridge
The Discord Chat Bridge is a communication bridge between Strawberry Chat & Discord.
With the help of [scapi](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Strawberry-Foundations/strawberry-chat/main/bot/scapi.py) & [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)
It also supports the new chat protocol (stbmv2) with the Canary version
