# Installing a package

You can install a package by using

```bash
spkg install [packagegroup]/<packagename>
```

`packagegroup` is optional, if there should be multiple packages with the same name, please use `packagegroup`

Replace `<packagename>` with the package you want to install e.g. `htop`, `libbismuth-git` or `python3.12`.

# Uninstalling a package

Uninstalling a package is very similar to installing a package, just run the same command you used to install the
package, but replace `install` with `remove`, like this:

```bash
spkg remove [packagegroup]/<packagename>
```

Package groups apply to removing packages too.
