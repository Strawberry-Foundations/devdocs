# Syncing
Syncing is the process where the spkg client retrives the server database in order to make a local copy of that database
to speed up things. This means that the database does not have to be retrieved from the server every time a package is installed.

<Warning>
But beware: Forgetting the synchronization process will result in
you will have an outdated database, which means that spkg will also install old packages. We therefore recommend updating the database every 2 - 3 times a week.
</Warning>

To sync the repository database with the local database, use

```bash
spkg sync
```

This could take some time depending on how large the database is.
