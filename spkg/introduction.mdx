# Why did you make spkg and what is it?
We wanted to make an alternative to system-specific package managers. spkg is designed to be cross-platform, which means
it runs on almost all Linux distros. It has containers, on-machine package compilation, package groups and much more.

It is similar to Gentoo's package manager [Portage](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Portage). It also features a container
feature similar to flatpak's approach.
