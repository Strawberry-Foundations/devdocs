# The very first beginning

The first Strawberry Team was founded it late 2021 with the biggest product being
SecureCloud, a cloud similar to Nextcloud, but with security in mind.
This project was later canceled in summer 2022 due to lack of development.

    Strawberry Software Industries was a volunteer organization whose mission was to program free & good software.
    Due to a lack of development, this organization never got very far and there was no official end to the organization.
    However, there is an approximate date where the development ended. This was June 9, 2022

    The GitHub organization team still exists and can be searched.

  <Accordion title="SecureCloud" icon="cloud" iconType="duotone">
  SecureCloud was an open source cloud, developed by Strawberry Software Industries, which was designed to prioritize security.
  The project began at the end of December 2021, but the first source code did not appear on GitHub until January 15, 2022.
  As there was a lot of confusion within the team, they didn't know how to proceed with the project.
  The last official commit on GitHub was on June 9, 2022 and the last official release was on March 24, 2022.

### Startings
The future of Strawberry Software Industries looked rather bleak.
There was no longer any desire to develop. The team had received a lot of hate because of their software, there were many disputes, and at some point we parted ways.
At some point we got back together, but we had only programmed for ourselves.

### The new beginning
At the beginning of this year (2023), we slowly started to feel like doing something as a team again. The first developments began and project ideas were collected.
The first project that can be found on our GitHub is [archhelper](https://github.com/Strawberry-Foundations/archhelper).
However, this project was never started and is therefore unofficially dead. 

### Strawberry Chat was born
Later in the year (towards the summer) we continued to develop a program that reflects our complete image: [Strawberry Chat](https://github.com/Strawberry-Foundations/strawberry-chat). 
The project already existed before summer 2023, but was never public and was not actively developed.
