description: How does the Strawberry Chat version principle work?
---

Strawberry Chat is updated regularly. There should usually be an update at least once a month.
If this does not happen, we are either currently under a lot of stress or we are doing a major update.
On this page you will see the different releases of Strawberry Chat and get to know our release policy.

# Version principle
We release at least one update approximately every month, as mentioned above. This can be a big one, with lots of new features, but also a small one, which only fixes bugs.
Depending on the situation, a major update is released **every 2 months**, and small bug and security updates for the current version in between.
After the release of a major version (e.g. v1.8.0) there is usually still a bug and security update (v1.8.1).

<Warning>
    The version principle is not one hundred percent fixed. It may be that 2 months in succession a major update is received, 
    but it is also possible that the next major update comes 3 months after a major update.

    As a rule, however, small updates are always released between these periods. However, this is also not fixed and it could also be the case 
    that no small updates are released at all (e.g. directly from v1.9.0 to v1.10.0 without intermediate updates).
</Warning>

<Info>
    The Strawberry Chat version series 1.8 receives a third and final bug and security update due to the [new communication system](/stbchat/stbm).
    This is called [Legacy Update](https://github.com/Strawberry-Foundations/strawberry-chat/tree/legacy)
    
    As a rule, no 3 further updates follow a version series, usually there is only one further update (e.g. v1.9.0 & v1.9.1)
