description: What is Strawberry Communication Standard (stbm)?

# What is this?
The Strawberry Chat communication system is currently being rewritten.
In order to distinguish between the old system and the new system, we are now introducing the Strawberry Communication System (stbm).
This communication system forms a standard for Strawberry Chat, and possibly for other Strawberry Foundations projects in the future. 

Currently we have 2 major versions of stbm. 
Version 1 `(stbmv1)` is a legacy version and no longer receives any new major updates. We only offer support for a certain period of time.

Version 2 `(stbmv2)` is a new, revised version of our communication system.
This uses JSON to transfer messages via the user.
With our new communication standard, users can now program their own message builder and decide for themselves how a message should be displayed, regardless of how the server had actually formatted the messages.
