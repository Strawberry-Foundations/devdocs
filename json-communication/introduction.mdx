title: Introduction to JSON Communication
description: This should give you a general idea what JSON Communication is about
---

# What? Why? How?
You may wonder and ask yourself what even is this? Well, this is a way how 2 socket instances communicate with
each-other, this was primarily designed for Strawberry Chat to send data between the server and the client such as
username, badges and messages, but we decided to make a small guide on how to implement it into your client.

# The Idea
The original concept for it was posted to our projects board on [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/Strawberry-Foundations/projects/1?pane=issue&itemId=44311144) on November 10th 2023

# Example code

<Info> This is a very basic example of JSON Communication which is used in Strawberry Chat </Info>

    ```json JSON
    {
        "message_type": "user_message", // Type of the message, usually user_message
        "username": "julian", // Username should be all lowercase and without spaces
        "nickname": "Julian The Great", // Nicknames can contain any UTF-8 character and spaces
        "badge": "ðŸ‘‘", // Emoji
        "role_color": "\u001b[31m\u001b[1m", // This uses ANSI colors, example given here is red & bold
        "message": {
            "content": "Hello World!"
        }
    }
    ```

    ```python Python
    # Receive code of the client
    ```
