title: Introduction to JSON Communication
description: This should give you a general idea what JSON Communication is about
---

# What? Why? How?
You may wonder and ask yourself what even is this? Well, this is a way how 2 socket instances communicate with
each-other, this was primarily designed for Strawberry Chat to send data between the server and the client such as
username, badges and messages, but we decided to make a small guide on how to implement it into your client.

<Tip>JSON communication is also another name for our Strawberry Communication Standard v2 (`stbmv2`). You can learn more about it [here](/stbchat/stbm)</Tip>

# The Idea
The original concept for it was posted to our projects board on [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/Strawberry-Foundations/projects/1?pane=issue&itemId=44311144) on November 10th 2023
Please note that this is currently only available in German.

# Example code

<Info> This is a very basic example of JSON Communication which is used in Strawberry Chat </Info>

<CodeGroup>

    ```json JSON
    {
        "message_type": "user_message", // Type of the message, usually user_message
        "username": "julian", // Username should be all lowercase and without spaces
        "nickname": "Julian The Great", // Nicknames can contain any UTF-8 character and spaces
        "badge": "üëë", // Emoji
        "role_color": "\u001b[31m\u001b[1m", // This uses ANSI colors, example given here is red & bold
        "message": {
            "content": "Hello World!"
        }
    }
    ```

    ```python Python
    # Receive code of the client
    def receive(sock):
        while threadFlag:
            try:
                message = sock.recv(2048).decode('utf-8')

                try: message = conv_json_data(message)
                except: message = message

                if message:
                    try:
                        try: message_type = message["message_type"]
                        except: message_type = "unknown"

                        if message_type == "user_message":
                        username    = message["username"]
                        nickname    = message["nickname"]
                        badge       = badge_handler(message["badge"])
                        role_color  = message["role_color"]
                        message     = message["message"]["content"]

                        if nickname == username:
                            fmt = f"[{current_time()}] {role_color}{username}{badge}:{CRESET} {message}"
                        else:
                            fmt = f"[{current_time()}] {role_color}{nickname} (@{username.lower()}){badge}:{CRESET} {message}"

                        print(fmt)

                    else:
                        message     = message["message"]["content"]
                        print(f"[{current_time()}] {message}")

                except Exception as e:
                    time.sleep(0.05)
                    message         = message["message"]["content"]
                    print(f"[{current_time()}] {message}")

            else: break

        except Exception as e:
            if experimental_debug_mode: print(f"{Fore.RED + BOLD}{Str[lang]['ConnectionInterrupt']}{Fore.RESET + CRESET}")
    pass
    ```

<Tip>
    ### Compatibility Mode (CM)
    As of Client Canary/Dev v2.5.1, we have added a feature that allows users to connect to old servers.
    This is called Compatibility Mode. To activate it you either have to add `compatibility_mode: true` to the respective legacy server entry or start the client with the `--compatibility-mode` flag!
